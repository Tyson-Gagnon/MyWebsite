                    <h3>
                        I am a software developer with a passion for learning and problem solving. I've been intereseted in technology since I was very young
                        and have always had a passion learning new programming languages and how computers work in general. I first learned to code when I was
                        around 14 because I wanted to make mods for my favourite games and my love for coding has spiraled since. I mainly learned Java and stuck
                        with it for most of my life, but I've also messed around with C++ and a little C#/.NET. My recent projects over the past year was to learn
                        Javascript and the basics in web dev using React as my library.
